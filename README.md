# 365 Commits Challenge 🚀

Welcome to the **365 Commits Challenge** repository! This challenge is about making a commit every single day for an entire year.  
The challenge is simple: stay consistent committing daily is easy, but maintaining **consistency** is the real challenge.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by months, with each day represented as a file:

- **January/** – Missed 2 days (I don’t remember why 🤔)
- **February/** – Missed 2 days (Procrastination 😴)
- **March/** – Missed 2 days (One day painting my house 🎨 + another day busy with a coding challenge 💻 and forgot to commit)
- **April/** – Continuing the challenge 🔥

Each file represents a commit made on that day, helping track progress over time.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

- Commit at least **once per day** for **365 days**.
- Build the habit of **daily coding and consistency**.
- Improve **discipline** and **accountability**.

## 📌 Progress Tracking

Although I missed a few days 2 in January, 2 in February, and 2 in March, I remain dedicated to the challenge and will keep pushing forward.

Even with a few missed days, **staying consistent is what truly matters!** 🔥🚀
